# User Generator Script Explanation

This Markdown document explains the JavaScript code that generates user information based on selected fields and displays it when a button is clicked.

## Event Listeners

The script begins by adding event listeners to various HTML elements when the DOM content is loaded.

1. `DOMContentLoaded` event listener waits for the HTML document to be fully loaded before executing any JavaScript code.

2. Event listeners are added to:
   - `generateButton`: Listens for clicks on a button with the ID `generateButton`.
   - `labels`: Listens for clicks on labels with the class `label`. Toggles the class `label-clicked` on click.

## `generateUsers` Function

This function is called when the "Generate" button is clicked.

1. It clears the contents of an HTML element with the ID `userList`.

2. It retrieves the selected fields and user count from the UI.

3. Checks if the user count is greater than 50 and displays an alert if it is.

4. Checks if at least one tag is selected and displays an alert if none are selected.

5. Fetches user data from a file named "users.json" using an asynchronous HTTP request (`fetch`).

6. Iterates through the user data and generates a random user's information based on the selected fields. It creates list items (`<li>`) for each user and appends them to the `userList` element.

7. Catches and logs any errors that occur during the fetch or parsing of JSON data.

## `getSelectedFields` Function

This function retrieves the selected fields from checkboxes in the UI.

1. Checks the state of various checkboxes with IDs like "nameCheckbox," "emailCheckbox," etc.

2. Pushes the field names ("name," "email," etc.) into an array if the corresponding checkbox is checked.

3. Returns an array of selected fields.

## `getRandomUser` Function

This function generates a random user's information based on the selected fields.

1. Takes an array of user data (`users`) and an array of selected fields as parameters.

2. Generates a random index to select a user object from the data.

3. Maps the selected fields to their values in the random user object and formats them into HTML anchor (`<a>`) elements.

4. Returns the formatted user information as a single string with line breaks (`<br>`).

This script essentially allows users to select certain fields and generate random user data based on those selections when clicking the "Generate" button.

Please note that this explanation assumes the existence of corresponding HTML elements with the specified IDs and classes.
